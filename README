This is a generalized linear model based on the public database located at: https://osf.io/3nr89/

In it, you will see a web scraping from Twitter. 

The generalized linear model pretends to understand the predictability that all the variables have on the retweet count. 
For this proposal I created a model based on the Poisson family, taking into consideration that the retweet count, as its name says, is a count of retweets.
Additionally, I set a log link that allows the model to make the bridge with the model for the predictability, behaving as a linear model and assuming other variables from other families. 


Hope you like the code... it's not finished, so I'm continuously adding pieces of the code.
